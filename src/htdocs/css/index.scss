@import css dependencies
@import scss partials

Note: There should exist at most one SCSS file for each web addressable page
in the application. Each SCSS file can import additional SCSS partials or CSS
files. Raw CSS files should be reserved for third-party libraries that do not
provide SCSS alternatives.

This file probably has only a minimal ammount of selectors/styles.
